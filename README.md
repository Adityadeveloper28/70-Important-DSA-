## Introduction

Data Structures and Algorithms are the backbone of computer science and software engineering. This repository aims to provide a comprehensive collection of 70 essential DSA problems, each with a detailed C++ implementation. These problems cover a wide range of topics, including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, sorting, searching, and more.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, you'll need to have a C++ compiler installed on your machine. If you don't have one, you can download and install GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) from [here](https://gcc.gnu.org/).

### Cloning the Repository

To clone this repository, use the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Adityadeveloper28/70-Important-DSA-.git
```

### Compiling and Running

Each DSA problem is contained within its own directory. To compile and run a specific problem, navigate to the problem's directory and use the following commands:

```bash
g++ problem_name.cpp -o problem_name
./problem_name
```

Replace `problem_name.cpp` with the name of the problem file you want to compile.

## Problems List

Below is a list of the 70 important DSA problems included in this repository. Each problem has its own directory containing the C++ implementation and a README file with problem details and explanations.
